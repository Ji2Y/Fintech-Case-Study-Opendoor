## ***Introduction: An innovative company in the Real Estate Industry.***
<br />Founded in 2014, Opendoor is a newly emerging Fintech company founded by Keith Rabois, Eric Wu, Ian Wong and JD Ross in San Francisco, with the goal of revolutionising home acquisition through faster and simpler procedures.
 
<br />Opendoor has been funded with large investors such as Softbank, General Atlantic and Google Ventures,having raised over $1.5 billion of capital funding in 2021.
 
 <br /> <br />

## ***Simplifying home transactions***
 <br />Homes are the most expensive assets that people owns, but selling a house pose some challenge, such as estimating the home pricing based on the market, demand and house component, and the time required for administration work before the settlement.
 
 <br />Opendoor aims to solve those problems through machine learning to create an estimation of the house price based on its size, the component (bedrooms and bathrooms) and buyers demand, while also providing almost instant transactions allowing the sellers and the buyers to complete the transaction without a waiting time. The system bypasses the need of a third party solicitors in order to complete the transactions.
 
 <br />At this current stage, any American residents can sell and purchase homes so long as their properties have a value between $200,000 and $500,000. One of the main appeal of using Opendoor is quick access to estimation, with the owner receiving an estimation of the value of their property and the ability of selling their home to the company at the valued price calculated using data and machine learning for price estimation.
  <br /> <br /><br />

## ***The Technology behind Opendoor***
  <br />
The technology used by the company can be divided into two main parts:
<br /> <br />- The first part is product engineering. The company started using Ruby on Rails and Angular for their website by creating a form so that clients could receive an estimation of how much they can sell their properties for. They also use Puma and Postgress as a webserver and storing database respectively. Finally, they also use Imgix to store the photos of their homes.
<br /> <br />- The second part is data science. After collecting datas from tax records and assessor datas, Opendoor uses Python for their main machine learning and Postgres as their main database collection.
 <br /> <br /><br />

## ***The Real Estate Industry Landscape***
  <br />
The Real Estate industry is one of the sectors that benefited the most in terms of data collection. Over the past 10 years, people who wanted to buy their home had to use Multiple Listing Services to find agents who will be introducing homes to the consumers based on their criterions. With time, data became more accessible to the general public, thus making Real Estate Agencies have less impact on the purchase decisions of the Buyers. Buyers can now have access to the library of available home for sale in listing websites such as Real Estates Australia, or Zillow, its American counterparts without relying on third party agents.
<br />
<br />


The Business model of Opendoor allowed redefining home transactions in the United States, selling over 120 homes per month. Its impact in the Real Estates market pushed its competitors to add technological features into their systems such as price and loan estimators, while unable to copy the easy and quick transaction system.
 <br /><br />
While traditional Real Estate websites rely into Auction Rate and the Return on Investments, Opendoor does not rely on an Auction system and instead can only been compared to other business models with its Return on Investments. 
Opendoor is expected to increase its Return of Investments and number of house transactions in the future, but the pandemic has given some challenge for the company and had to halt their home acquisition, decreasing their revenue in 2020 by 45%.
 
 <br /><br />

## ***Ideas that could make Opendoor a better industry***
 
<br />The main appeal of Opendoor is both the speed of the transaction and also machine learning to have a quick access of the conditions of the Real Estate Market.
The House Market is not only appealing for those who seek to purchase a property, but also for those who are purchasing assets to create passive income.
 
<br />It would be interesting to see Opendoors appealing to that niche of the market on top of future home-owners.
 
<br />Using machine learning and data, it would be possible to create an estimation of the rental return of a property and calculate the Estimate Return on Investments for potential Real Estate investors if they wish to buy a property in order to get passive income. 
 
<br />One of the key challenges of Real Estate investments is the need of having high capital to start a renting business, which could be solved using blockchain technology. By splitting the ownership of a property into multiple tokens, potential investors do not need to purchase the full amount of the property to start investments and any remaining tokens would belong to Opendoor, who can use those tokens to collect yield through rental investments. Investors thus purchase the tokens for the yield it can potentially provide to them, with assets that are guaranteed to last long terms.
